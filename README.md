# Rock Paper Scissors - Multiplayer Game

This is based on the PlayroomKit demo https://docs.joinplayroom.com/usage/react

A real-time multiplayer rock paper scissors game built with React and PlayroomKit. Play against friends in the same room or remotely!
Still a work in progress, not sure what happens if more then 2 people try to join a game because in order to test that i would need more friends :(

2. Wait for another player to join
3. Select your move: ⛰️ Rock, 🧻 Paper, or ✂️ Scissors
